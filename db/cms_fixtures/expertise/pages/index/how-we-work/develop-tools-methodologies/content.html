<p>Information is essential for making good decisions. But information about biodiversity needs to be available in appropriate forms that specialists can access, and non-specialists can understand. We analyse, interpret and present information in ways that are easy to understand, visual and intuitive. The <a href="">Species+ website</a> contains up-to-date information about the 34,000 species of animals and plants whose trade is controlled under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). This provides a vital resource for the people responsible for managing and controlling the worldwide trade in endangered species.</p>
