<p>UNEP-WCMC and the CITES Secretariat have built a new data management platform, Species+, which includes the full list of all species listed in the CITES Appendices, together with their taxonomy, legislation, distribution and any trade restrictions that may apply. Species lists will be available for download by CITES Parties and the general public, including traders and scientific institutions. Species+, built using modern technologies, will also form the basis for future &ldquo;computer to computer&rdquo; communication to automatically synchronise national systems with the same CITES species lists across the world.</p>
<p>Species+ will help Parties meet their international commitments by providing them with easy access to the information they need to issue permits for trade, thereby facilitating the effective management of species and ensuring that trade in CITES-listed species is legal, traceable and sustainable.</p>
