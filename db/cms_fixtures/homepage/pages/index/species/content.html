<p>The module consists of five lessons, each of which will take about 30-45 minutes to complete. The first lesson provides an introduction to the key concepts and definitions, while the next four lessons cover the ‘Biodiversity Indicator Development Framework’. This framework has been developed from the experience of the BIP to promote successful biodiversity indicators.
A sixth lesson on ‘incorporating indicators into NBSAPs’ is in development. This lesson will look at key considerations for indicator development at the different stages of the NBSAP updating process.
The module is hosted on The Nature Conservancy’s dedicated e-learning platform, www.conservationtraining.org, and is free and available to anyone wishing to learn more about developing biodiversity indicators.
