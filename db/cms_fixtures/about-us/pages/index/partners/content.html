			<h1>Our partners</h1>
			<p>We work with public and private organisations at national and international levels. We are funded on a project-by-project basis and do not receive core funding from any organisation.</p>

			<h2>International organisations</h2>
            <p>We work with a large number of international partner organisations. We are the specialist biodiversity centre of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and collaborate with all divisions of UNEP.  We work closely with the secretariats of multilateral environmental agreements, such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), and intergovernmental organisations like the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).</p>

			<h2>National governments</h2>
            <p>We help national governments to manage the environment better and meet their international obligations under the multilateral environmental agreements to which they are signatories. We work with governments in the developing and developed world. In the UK, we coordinated the UK National Ecosystem Assessment which evaluated the state of the UKâ€™s ecosystems, and trends affecting them. This allowed the government to make informed choices about how to manage the national environmental resource.</p>

			<h2>Private sector</h2>
            <p>We help our business partners to understand, assess and manage biodiversity in their operations. We support the development of global business approaches, such as standards and codes of practice, and we work with individual companies to help them implement good practices that minimise the impacts of their operations on biodiversity.</p>

			<h2>Research institutions, NGOs and foundations</h2>
            <p>We partner with many non-governmental organisations, research institutions and foundations. We have on-going, long term partnerships, such as our work over the past 30 years with IUCN on the World Database on Protected Areas, and we manage many short term projects, funded by foundations and NGOs, often in collaboration with academic and research institutions.</p>
