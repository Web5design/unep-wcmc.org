<p>We partner with many non-governmental organisations, research institutions and foundations. We have on-going, long term partnerships, such as our work over the past 30 years with IUCN on the World Database on Protected Areas, and we manage many short term projects, funded by foundations and NGOs, often in collaboration with academic and research institutions.</p>
