<p>We help national governments to manage the environment better and meet their international obligations under the multilateral environmental agreements to which they are signatories.

In the UK, we coordinated the UK National Ecosystem Assessment which evaluated the state of the UK&rsquo;s ecosystems, and trends affecting them. This allowed the government to make informed choices about how to manage the national environmental resource.</p>
