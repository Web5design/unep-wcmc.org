  <h2>The problem</h2>
  <p>CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, is an international treaty between governments, whose purpose is to ensure that international trade in the specimens of wild fauna and flora does not threaten the survival of species in the wild. CITES protects tens of thousands of species of animals and plants against over-exploitation through international trade, and these species are listed in three Appendices, based on the degree of protection required. Efficient access to these CITES-listed species data sets is critical in planning and implementing strategies to manage endangered and threatened species, especially in CITES permitting and trade verification.</p>
  <p>However, at present, access to such data infrastructures is limited, and every time a new species is added to the CITES Appendices, each country involved in the international agreement must independently update its own system. This results in a lack of consistency across countries, and innovative developments, such as e-permitting and further automation of reporting processes, struggle to progress further.</p>

  <h2>Our solution &amp; impact</h2>
  <p>UNEP-WCMC and the CITES Secretariat have built a new data management platform, Species+, which includes the full list of all species listed in the CITES Appendices, together with their taxonomy, legislation, distribution and any trade restrictions that may apply. Species lists will be available for download by CITES Parties and the general public, including traders and scientific institutions. Species+, built using modern technologies, will also form the basis for future “computer to computer” communication to automatically synchronise national systems with the same CITES species lists across the world.</p>
  <p>Species+ will help Parties meet their international commitments by providing them with easy access to the information they need to issue permits for trade, thereby facilitating the effective management of species and ensuring that trade in CITES-listed species is legal, traceable and sustainable.</p>
