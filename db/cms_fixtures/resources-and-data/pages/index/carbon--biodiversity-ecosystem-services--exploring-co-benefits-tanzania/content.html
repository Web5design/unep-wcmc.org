The maintenance and enhancement of natural carbon stocks is now considered a key climate change mitigation measure. Emissions from land use change, mainly tropical forest loss, contribute an estimated 17.4% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (IPCC 2007a), equivalent to around 5.8 Gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year.
